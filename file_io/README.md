# C - File I/O

## Learning Objectives
- How to create, open, close, read and write files
- What are file descriptors
- What are the 3 standard file descriptors, what are their purpose and what are their POSIX names
- How to use the I/O system calls open, close, read and write
What are and how to use the flags O_RDONLY, O_WRONLY, O_RDWR
- What are file permissions, and how to set them when creating a file with the open system call
- What is a system call
- What is the difference between a function and a system call

## Requirements
- compile using __gcc__, using the options __-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89__
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
- Code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
- Not allowed to use global variables
- No more than 5 functions per file
- The only C standard library functions allowed are malloc, free and exit. Any use of functions like printf, puts, calloc, realloc etcâ€¦ is forbidden
- Allowed syscalls: read, write, open, close
- Header filed should be called __main.h__
- Tip: always prefer using symbolic constants (POSIX) vs numbers when it makes sense. For instance read(STDIN_FILENO, ... vs read(0, ...
