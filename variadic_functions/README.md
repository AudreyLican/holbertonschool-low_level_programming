C - Variadic functions
Learning Objectives Upon completion of this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts without relying on external resources:

General
1 - Variadic Functions: Understand what variadic functions are. Learn how to use va_start, va_arg, and va_end macros in variadic functions.

2 - Const Keyword: Understand the purpose and usage of the const type qualifier. Explore why and how to use const in C programming.

Requirements
Allowed Editors: vi, vim, emacs
Compilation: All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc with the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89.
File Endings: All files should end with a new line.
README.md: A README.md file at the root of the project folder is mandatory.
Coding Style: Your code should follow the Betty style, checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl.
Global Variables: Not allowed.
Functions per File: No more than 5 functions per file.
C Standard Library Functions: Only allowed functions are malloc, free, and exit. Functions like printf, puts, calloc, realloc, etc., are forbidden.
Macros: Allowed to use va_start, va_arg, va_end, and _putchar.
_putchar.c: You don't have to push _putchar.c; it will be provided by us.
Main.c Files: The provided main.c files are for testing purposes. You can use them to test your functions, but don't push them to your repo; we will use our own main.c files at compilation.
Header File: Prototypes of all functions and the _putchar function should be included in a header file named variadic_functions.h.
Header File Guard: All header files should be include guarded.
Note: Remember to push your header file.
